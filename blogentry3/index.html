    BLOG ENTRY #3
<br>
<br>
<br>


At this point I started creating the website blog, documenting a mood that the brand embodies as a whole. That theme is dark and ominous, but also combined with a more modern and minimal approach. Most of the images on the blog encapture a sense of the brand name; white noise. Thus, images with confusing and blurry effects, mostly dark and monochromatic but also some with tasteful color added, were included in the blog.
    
    <br>
<br>
    
The screenshots below show the process of making the blog. To make the blog more interactive, I will make sure to add microinteractins within the blog, and add gifs with constantly changing content to add a sense of movement to the page.

<br> <br> 
The major pages that need to be developed include the navigation page, and the product pages themselves. Considering that there is a large amount of products on the website, and they are all so similar, I was thinking that maybe having a page for each is not the best option for designing the website, but also for the user too, as he would have to click on a variety of pages just go to through basic product information.
    
 
    <br> <br>
Therefore, I started building a sample product page, shown in the screenshot below:
</p>   
    
    
<img src="Photos/website/2.png" height=400px; /> 
<img src="Photos/3.png" height=400px; /> 
    
    
    <br> <br> <br> <br>
    
    
<p>
Since having a page per product could potentially be a little overwhelming for the user to keep clicking and keep getting re-routed into another page, I started considering how the sample product page above would look and work if it was in the form of a pop-up style page, when you click over the product, to create a small box over the page were you can add the product to your cart.
