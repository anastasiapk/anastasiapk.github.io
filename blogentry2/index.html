    BLOG ENTRY #2
<br>
<br>
<br>

    <br> <br> <br>
I will be gathering information by interviewing each designer based on their personal style, the feel and mood that they wish to convey as designers, so that I represent their products using stylistic features that convey the emotions they have in mind when designing. For instance, some of the artists have a more dark and gothic feel, compared to the others that have a more colorful approach and funny attitude.
</p>
   
    
    <br> <br>

Initially I conducted an interview with the designers altogether to help them create a sense of the brand, consider their main theme and the emotions that they want to convey. This was a highly critical step, as the brand seemed a little confused on a holistic level as to what style the brand is going to take. 
    
<br> <br> Since we decided that each designer has their own style that clashes with the rest of the designs, we decided that the brand will work as a Collective of a variety of designers, and the shop will be separated within sub-sections, depending on the cohesiveness of the designs when placed next to eacch other.
    
 
    <br> <br>
Based on the interview and discussion, I proposed to them a couple of visual tests for the website design. The images below show the prototypes for the main page, navigation and shop pages:

<img src="Photos/website/2.png" height=400px; /> 
<img src="Photos/website/3.png" height=400px; /> 
<img src="Photos/website/4.png" height=400px; /> 
    
    
    <br> <br> <br> <br>
    
    
<p>
Manipulation of the photographs given was necessary before uploading on the website. Without this, the images would look more static on the page because of the square white background. This approach seems more modern as the products can flow on the page and I could potentially add a more visually compelling background. The screenshots below show the process of using tools like the magnetic lasso tool and the magic eraser to remove the background for all the products.

These are screenshots from Adobe Photoshop image manipulation:

Another component to making the website is the backgrounds to all the pages. Being that my other classes have exposed me to using various Adobe programs including AfterEffects, I thought it would be a good idea to combine my knowledge into this project too to create strong and compelling visual designs for each page. 
<br> <br>
These are some examples of tests that I made on AfterEffects for the White Noise brand:
