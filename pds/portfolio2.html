    <h1>Personal Design System</h1>
    <p>The following content was made within the past two years for various assignments for classes taken for my major, Communication Design, BFA.</p>
      <p> All content was created using either Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign, depending on the form or purpose of the assignment.

    <h1>formatting and EXPERIMENTATION </h1>
    <p>The majority of my work starts on a physical platform, using either pen or pencil on paper to plan and sketch. It then gets converted to take a digital form of unlimited potential of editing and manipulation. 
        
        <br> <br> This piece in particular started in the notebook and was then digitalized on Adobe Illustrator, as presented in the screenshots on the right. </p>

    <h1>Designer Values</h1>
      <p> Modern design and typography are main components to my work aesthetic. I try to incorporate my knowledge from Typography classes into all projects I embark on, attempting to convey a certain message or tone through visual communication. 
          
          <br> <br>
         Design agencies that I would be interested to work for in the future include companies or agencies with a collision of modern, minimal, and maybe European-influenced visual aesthetic; a collision of Typography and graphic design. Including Pentagram, Base, Experimental Jetset, DIA, Spin, A Practice for Everyday Life, and much more.

          <h1>The Killers</h1>
    <p>This poster in the back is from last semester Studio Typography, from an assignment where we had to make a poster for any musician's concert. It was made using 770 red dots and some black text to balance out the composition.
      
      <br> <br> As it may be noticed through this small portfolio, I tend to use a very simple color palette, often using shades of black and white, but surprisingly also a lot of red.  </p>

<h1> Language Explorations </h1>
    <p>Having a strong interest in Typography, a lot of my projects are explored through various languages. For instance, the piece on the back is a scanned handwritten experiment made using felt-tip, based on a mixture of languages, eventually forming my own.
      <br> <br>
        Working with a variety of languages is imperative in today's globalized setting. I enjoy working with typography, especially because I hope and plan to live and work in several countries around the world, including in Europe, as Graphic Design is very innovative and radical in countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc. Most of the modern typography and graphic design movements have sprung out of these two geographical locations.
