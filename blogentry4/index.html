    BLOG ENTRY #4
<br>
<br>
<br>

After showing the group of designers the prototypes, and getting their feedback on personal preference for the design and aesthetic of the website, we started considering how to make the website more interactive for the user.
    
    <br>
<br>
    
The image below demonstrates an example of an interactive element that could be incorporated onto the website. I set the image to change into an unstoppably moving GIF when you hover over. 
    
    <br> <br>

</p>
   
    
    
    <div class="trebble"> 
    </div>
 
    
    <br> 
    
<p>

    
<br> 
This is one form of interaction that will be added to the website but using text saying White Noise instead, and the contet itself will vary depending on the button/link used. The moving GIF effect will be formed using Adobe AfterEffects and will be rendered using Adobe Photoshop so that it may be exported as a GIF, since AfterEffects exports in MOV.
 
    <br> <br>
Still building the sample product page from last week, I continued adding products on pages, displayed in the screenshot below:

<img src="Photos/3.png" height=400px; /> 
    
    
    <br> <br> <br> <br>
    
    
<p>
In addition, I continued adding to the website's main page. Along with the designers, we decided that the main page plays a highly significant and critical role in the presentation of the wesbite and brand as a whole. Therefore, we considered the content that can be used and the overall presentation going to be included in the main page. 
    
<br> <br> Is it just going to be a video page with effects or maybe should it become the official navigation page too? For instance, it may have no links on it, making it a simple home page with an effect that will hopefully entertain the viewer and get him excited to get to the navigation page and eventually shop. On the other hand, I tested how the page would look when adding a bunch of links, hopefully making this home page as a main navigation page, so that a simple page with effects can be skipped and people can go straight to the online store.
    
<br> <br>
The screenshot below shows the test we made as a main page, whilst the effect in the background (made in AfterEffects) will be in the works:
