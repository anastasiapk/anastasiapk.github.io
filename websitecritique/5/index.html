Ok Focus is a very modern digital agency that takes on creative projects from all sectors.
<br>
<br>
Their design aesthetic is clearly very modern and innovative, fitting in to and successfully representing their values and aesthetic as an agency. The first page that is presented to the viewer is coded so that it moves around, creating a very fresh and lively feel.

    <p>
As you hover over the projects listed on the top-left side of the screen, the whole main page changes depending on the type of project, to a repeated black and white image. It also moves with the mouse, making a unique and unusual effect as you hover on the screen.
<br>
<br>
On the top-right side of the screen it has a list of selected press, and using the same hover effect, the images change using the same black and white repeated style, depending on the type of press publication.

If you want to get more information or see a portfolio, you can click the option on the bottom-right hand side, which automatically opens up your email so you send them a direct request. 
<br>
<br>
I have to admit I wasn't a very big fan of the fact that it just opened up to my mail, it felt somewhat invasive, as if they are getting access to open my personal applications. I think it would be more convenient if they had an online form where you write your name, email and comment and then they contact you back.

Overall, even though the structure of the webpage is fairly simple, the interesting visuals and code make it very interactive and successfully give the webpage, and therefore, the agency, a modern and interesting feel. 
<br>
<br>
However, it is somewhat basic as a website, and it is quite hard to navigate through, whilst I also think it is not particularly informative, especially for an individual who has no idea what OKFocus is before they visit the page.
