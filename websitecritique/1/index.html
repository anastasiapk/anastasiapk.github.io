  WEBSITE CRITIQUE #1
  <h1>

	<p>
The first two websites I wanted to compare are some of the sources I used last summer when searching for apartments in New York.
	</p>

<a href="https://www.streeteasy.com/">StreetEasy.com</a>
<br>

	<p>
Street Easy is a website used by clients looking for apartments in several locations around the world. Today we are going to focus on the
directory for New York listings.
<br>
<br>
From the minute you land on the main page, you are presented with an organized structure to search through, and several photographs of trending listings
and options to press depending on if you are looking for Sales, Rentals, or depending on the location you are looking for.
<br>
<br>
In addition, if you don't know any of the above yet and you just want to take a look around, you have options to guide you through
your search such as "Neighborhood Guide" and "Tips".

<br>
	<p>
The structure of the website looks clear and organized for the viewer. You are able to navigate through the website easily depending on what you are
looking for. As you scroll over the listings, the map on the side updates with a checkmark on it, so you are able to directly see where the apartment is located.

	<p>
As you search for your ideal apartment, you can refine your search to get results of exactly what you are looking for. In the photo above, the refine your search bar is clicked on, and there are several options to refine your search depending on how mnay bedrooms or bathrooms you want, location, fee, rent and more.
<br>
  <br>
As you scroll down the refine your search bar, you get a list of amenities such as a gym, elevator, laundry, doorman, parking, etc. This is very convenient for the user as you get to refine your search and find your ideal apartment without having to search through a long list of apartments listings.
	</p>

	<p>
The data itself could potentially be unreliable, for instance some images look quite sketchy, but since there are agents involved, it makes the listings more reliable and it is a good opportunity to meet an agent if you are looking for one, so if that specific apartment is not available, you can find another one.
</p>
<br>

  <br>
<p>
When you actually click on a specific apartment listing, you get to see a collection of images, and a variety of information about the listing such as location, square feet, rent, description, when it is available, and finally and most importantly, the name and contact information of the real-estate agent.
