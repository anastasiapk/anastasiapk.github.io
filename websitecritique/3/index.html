The Pirate Bay is technically an illegal source of torrents for individuals around the world to download media and software, including music, movies, books and much more for free. 
<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that it is theoretically illegal, and it is targeted by the police for sharing copyrighted media for free, the website commonly changes name or gets information changed or deleted very often.

    <p>
The structure of the website looks extremely rudimentary as well. It is definitely not the most user-friendly website to find what you are looking to download. 
<br>
<br>
However, that doesn't stop users from using it as individuals who visit this website are usually looking for something in particular and Pirate Bay, along with some other websites, is a good source to get what they want.

	<p>
The structure of the website is fairly clear, but again, definitely not ideal. Comparing it to other websites, the search engine is very basic and inconvenient if you are looking for something very particular. 
<br>
  <br>
In addition, the way in which all the download links and torrents are listed is quite confusing, as they are all just listed one on top of the other without any order or specification.
	</p>

	<p>
The data itself could also potentially be unreliable, since it is illegal and it is a fairly disorganized system. Also, some torrents may be infused with hidden viruses that harm your computer when you download them.
<br>
<br>
For instance, it may have scams that are not obvious to notice, because all the torrents are illegally downloaded from anybody around the world with no safe measure.
