  WEBSITE CRITIQUE #2
  <h1>
  
  <p>
The first two websites I wanted to compare are some of the sources I used last summer when searching for apartments in New York.
  </p>
  
<a href="https://www.nybits.com/">NYBits.com</a>
<br>

NYBits is an old website used primarily by real estate agents or users who may have come across it. However, not many people know of it, 
whilst the whole website looks somewhat abandoned. 
<br>
<br>
The difference between NYBits and another commercialized website used to find homes is that you do not need an agent to view the apartments
listed on the directory. Therefore, all listings are created by any individual owner who is interested in either buying or selling their apartment.
In addition, the apartments listed are all no-fee, making them even cheaper.
	</p>

    <p>
The structure of the website looks extremely rudimentary. It is definitely not the most user-friendly website to find an apartment in New York 
City but the fact that its content very unique compared to other commercialized websites, it's worth visiting for a quick search if you are
looking for a house with a low budget. 
<br>
<br>
Due to its lack of recognition, the fact that you do not need an agent, and all apartments listed are "No-Fee", 
you are very likely to find an affordable and ideal 'hidden gem' in the city that you would not be able to find elsewhere. 
	</p>

	<p>
The structure of the website is fairly clear, but it is definitely not ideal. Comparing it to other websites like Renthop and StreetEasy,
the search engine is very basic and inconvenient if you are looking for something very particular. 
<br>
  <br>
For example, someone may be looking for a specific type of apartment with a specific list of amenities such as a 
terrace, laundry, doorman, be close to a specific  etc. Also, the fact that the apartments are listed all in text one on top of the other
without any images or clear structure, can make the list look overwhelmingly long. As a user, you are eventually forced to open an inconvenient
amount of tabs until you can see all the listings 
	</p>

	<p>
The data itself could also potentially be unreliable, since there are no agents involved and it is a fairly disorganized system. 
<br>
<br>
For instance, it may have scams that are not obvious to notice, some listings do not even include images, and some apartments are even uploaded with
fake images of other apartments, or wrong characteristics and amenities, since the owners are uploading them directly.
