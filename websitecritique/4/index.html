The structure of the website looks clear and organized. It is a simple and user-friendly website used for clients and shoppers to either look around at some new styles or search for some in particular.
<br>
<br>
 When you first open to the main page, you are presented with a variety of visuals and photographs inspiring you to find a style of clothing that works for you, or check out their lookbook with ideas.

The structure of the website is fairly clear, and convenient if you are looking for something very particular. When you hover over either the Womens or Mens section, you get a list of subcategories. 
<br>   
<br>
 On one hand, this may be kind of confusing because of the large number of options listed, but as an online shopper, if you are looking for something in particular, for instance a dress, it is a quick way to navigate through the sections of the Women's clothing.

Since a lot of online shoppers go on this website to find something in particular, and since there is a huge directory of clothes on this webpage, it is imperative that there is a refine search option so that if someone is looking for a specific type of clothing with a specific size, length or style, they can search it straight away and find exactly what they are looking for.
<br>
<br>
Therefore the search engine and refine search option is extremely helpful and convenient for the online user, making their interaction with the webpage a pleasant shopping experience.
